= Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a formalism used to describe the time and space complexity of an algorithm.

It is defined based on the input size of the algorithm.

The notation is as follows:

* *O(1):* The algorithm will always take the same amount of time or space, regardless of the input size.
* *O(log n):* The algorithm's duration increases logarithmically as the input size grows, resulting in slower growth over time.
* *O(n):* The algorithm's duration will grow proportionally to the size of the input.
* *O(n²):* The algorithm's duration will grow proportionally to the square of the input size.
* *O(2ⁿ):* The algorithm's duration will grow exponentially with the size of the input.
* *O(n!):* The algorithm's duration will grow factorially with the size of the input, leading to extremely rapid growth.
